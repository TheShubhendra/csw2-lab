/*

- The program follows the principles of loose coupling and high cohesion by separating the concerns of different classes and ensuring that each class has a single responsibility.
- The `Student` class is responsible for representing a student and maintaining the list of enrolled courses for each student.
- The `Course` class is responsible for representing a course and its capacity.
- The `Enrollment` class is responsible for managing the enrollment of students in courses and storing the enrollment details in a hashmap.
- The `EnrollmentSystem` interface defines the methods for enrollment management and allows the `Enrollment` class to interact with the other classes indirectly through the interface.
- The `Main` class is responsible for demonstrating the system's functionality by creating some students and courses, and calling the methods of the `Enrollment` class.
- The program uses appropriate error handling and user-friendly output messages to handle invalid or unsuccessful operations, such as enrolling in a full or non-existent course, dropping from a non-enrolled or non-existent course, or displaying the enrollment details of a non-existent course.
